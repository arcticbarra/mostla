"AI means that machines can perform tasks in ways that are 'intelligent.' These machines aren't just programmed to do a single, repetitive motion -- they can do more by adapting to different situations.People are seeking to create machines that can make decisions in similar ways to humans and use those decisions to complete tasks.\n\nNeural networks are a type of computer system that's made to classify information like our own brains do. These networks use the data they have access to make determinations. The data doesn't allow them to be perfectly accurate, but they can make decisions based on what's most likely to be right.\n\nMost importantly, these systems involve a feedback loop for 'learning'. The machine can find out whether or not its decisions were right, and then change its approach to do better next time." = "AI means that machines can perform tasks in ways that are 'intelligent.'
